description: A Helm chart for deploying the amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook to support IRSA
# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# Should be incremented to match the appVersion.
# If using the docker pipeline, this will be done automatically to match the version in
# package.json
version: 1.0.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application.
# If using the docker pipeline, this will be done automatically to match the version in
# package.json
appVersion: 1.0.0
